Your customers will be able to create profiles, search for sitters based on location and availability, read reviews from other pet owners, and securely book and pay for services.\n\nPet sitters will have their own profiles where they can showcase their experience, set their availability, and manage booking requests. The platform will include a messaging system so owners and sitters can communicate directly.\n\nYour admin dashboard will give you full control over the platform, allowing you to manage users, monitor bookings, and ensure quality service.\n\nThe platform will work seamlessly on both mobile phones and desktop computers, making it accessible to all your potential users. We'll implement secure payment processing, location-based searching, and real-time availability updates to create a smooth and trustworthy experience for everyone involved."
